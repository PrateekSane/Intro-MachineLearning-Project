# Intro-MachineLearning-Projects
Created a Digit Recognition algorithm from scratch in MatLab. Created all the functions and learned the linear algebra behind the neural network. Achieved 94% accuracy on a test set of 1000. 

Created a Clothing Recognition algorithm in Python using TensorFlow. Learned how TensorFlow works and helped me better understand the concetpts behind neural networks
